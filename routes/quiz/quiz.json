      "d) An object-oriented language"
    ],
    "answer": "a) A statically typed language",
    "explanation": "TypeScript is a statically typed language, meaning that type information is known at compile time, allowing for better tooling, stronger type safety and making it easier to catch type errors before runtime.",

    "question": "How do you declare a variable in TypeScript?",
    "options": ["a) var x;", "b) let x;", "c) const x;", "d) define x;"],
    "answer": "b) let x;",
    "explanation": "TypeScript follows the same syntax as JavaScript in declaring variables. The 'var' keyword is not recommended in TypeScript and should be replaced by 'let' or 'const', depending on whether the value of the variable can change or not.",

      "b) 'const' can change its value, 'let' cannot",
      "c) Both 'let' and 'const' can change their value",
      "d) Neither 'let' nor 'const' can change their value"
    ],
    "answer": "a) 'let' can change its value, 'const' cannot",
    "explanation": "'Let' allows you to reassign a new value to the variable, while 'const' creates a constant variable, whose value cannot be changed once it has been assigned.",

    "answer": "a) A blueprint for objects",
    "explanation": "An interface in TypeScript defines a blueprint for objects. It specifies the structure of an object, including the properties it should have and their respective types, making it easier to write and maintain code that works with objects of a certain structure.",

    ],
    "answer": "b) To provide hints about the expected data type of a variable",
    "explanation": "Type annotations in TypeScript are used to provide hints about the expected data type of a variable, function return value, or function parameter. They help the TypeScript compiler to catch type-related errors before the code is run.",

    "answer": "a) let is block-scoped while var is function-scoped",
    "explanation": "In TypeScript, the let keyword is used to declare block-scoped variables, while the var keyword is used to declare function-scoped variables. This means that variables declared with let are only accessible within the block in which they are defined, while variables declared with var are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are defined.",

      "d) A way to create reusable code"
    ],
    "answer": "d) A way to create reusable code",
    "explanation": "Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable code that can work with multiple types, rather than having to write separate code for each type. They allow you to write functions, classes, and interfaces that can work with any type, and to specify the types they should work with when they are called or used.",

    ],
    "answer": "c) Null values are treated as a separate type",
    "explanation": "TypeScript has a \"null\" type, which is separate from other types like \"number\", \"string\", etc. By default, TypeScript considers variables that are assigned a \"null\" value to have the type \"null\", which can then be used in type annotations and type checks.",

      "c) By declaring the property as \"undefined\"",
      "d) By declaring the property with a default value"
    ],
    "answer": "a) By adding a \"?\" after the property name",
    "explanation": "In TypeScript, you can declare an optional property in an interface by adding a \"?\" after the property name. This means that the property is optional and doesn't have to be provided when implementing the interface.",

      "d) To enforce strict typing of undefined values"
    ],
    "answer": "a) To enforce strict typing of null values",
    "explanation": "The \"strictNullChecks\" compiler option in TypeScript enables stricter checking for null and undefined values. When \"strictNullChecks\" is set to true, TypeScript will not allow implicit conversions between null and undefined, making it easier to catch potential bugs in your code.",

    ],
    "answer": "a) By using the \"?\" symbol after the property name",

    "answer": "c) A way to represent a set of named values in TypeScript",
    "explanation": "An enum in TypeScript is a way to represent a set of named values. Enums allow you to define a set of named values that represent a specific set of values, such as a set of days of the week or a set of colors. Enums are defined using the \"enum\" keyword, followed by the name of the enum and the set of named values. Each named value in an enum is given a specific integer value, starting from 0, unless you specify a different value. Enums are useful for representing a specific set of values that you want to use throughout your code, while still ensuring type safety and making your code more readable.",
