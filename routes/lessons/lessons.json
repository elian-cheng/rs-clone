      "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features such as classes and interfaces.",
      "It is designed to make large-scale JavaScript applications more manageable and scalable. TypeScript code can be transpiled (converted) into plain JavaScript, allowing it to run in any JavaScript environment.",
      "This can make development easier by catching type-related errors at compile-time, rather than runtime. TypeScript is widely used in Angular, Ionic and other big projects.",
      "It provides three main benefits: \n1.Finding some kinds of errors before running the code. \n2.Easier code refactoring. \n3.Full support for editor features: auto-completion, code navigation, etc."

    "examples": [
      "console.log('Hello, World!')",
      "Benefits of type cheking: \nfunction sum(a: number, b: number) {\nreturn a + b;\n} \n sum(10n, 5) // Argument of type 'bigint' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'."

      "In TypeScript, variables can be declared using the 'let' or 'const' keywords.",
      "'Let' is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned a new value. 'Const' is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned a new value, once it is declared.",
      "In addition to let and const, TypeScript also supports the var keyword for variable declarations. However, the let and const are preferred over var because they have better scoping behavior.",
      "TypeScript also allows you to specify the type of a variable when declaring it, using a colon ':' followed by the type.",
      "TypeScript supports many built-in types like number, string, boolean, etc and also allows to create custom types using interfaces and classes."

      "Let: \nx = 10; // x is now 10",
      "Const: \ny = 10; // error: y is read-only",
      "Type declaration: \nlet x: number = 5"
